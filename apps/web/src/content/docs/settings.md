# Adamosophy Settings Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the configuration options available in the Adamosophy user settings page. Users can customize their experience by selecting preferred rendering methods, display options, and interaction preferences.

## Markdown Rendering Options

Adamosophy provides **3 optional ways to render Markdown** content. Users can set their preferred method in the **User Settings** section of their profile. This flexibility ensures optimal reading experience based on individual preferences for performance, visual style, or ecosystem integration.

### 1. Marked + GitHub Markdown CSS
- **Description**: Uses the `marked` library for fast Markdown parsing combined with `github-markdown-css` for authentic GitHub-style appearance.
- **Best For**: Users who want exact GitHub-like rendering with minimal overhead.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Fast parsing speed
  - Familiar GitHub visual style
  - Lightweight dependency footprint

### 2. Remark / Rehype Ecosystem
- **Description**: Leverages the powerful `remark` and `rehype` plugin ecosystem (used internally by Astro) for advanced Markdown processing.
- **Best For**: Users who need extensibility or want consistency with the Astro build pipeline.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Highly configurable via plugins
  - Seamless integration with Astro's internal processing
  - Supports custom transformations and syntax highlighting

### 3. Tailwind Typography Plugin
- **Description**: Implements `@tailwindcss/typography` with the `prose` class to automatically style rendered HTML from Markdown.
- **Best For**: Users who prefer design consistency with the rest of the Tailwind-styled application.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Beautiful, opinionated default styles
  - Zero custom CSS required
  - Perfect integration with existing Tailwind utility classes

## User Interface for Selection

For initial implementation and testing, a **tristate toggle** will be available in the drawer component, allowing users to quickly switch between the three rendering methods. In future iterations, this setting will be moved to a dedicated Settings Modal/Page for better organization, while the viewer itself may retain a simple "View Mode" switcher for temporary overrides.
