# Adamosophy Vision

## What is Adamosophy?

Adamosophy is a website hosting a **showroom of applications designed for humanity**. 

Our mission is to curate, showcase, and provide access to software applications that serve human flourishing, well-being, and advancement. Each application in our showroom is carefully selected to contribute positively to the human experience.

## Repository Vision

The Adamosophy repository is designed as a **monorepo** containing 'child' repositories that house the actual applications for humanity. This structure allows us to:

- Maintain a unified documentation and presentation layer
- Coordinate cross-application initiatives
- Provide a consistent user experience across all showcased applications
- Enable easy discovery and navigation between related tools

### Monorepo Structure

```
adamosophy/
├── docs/              # Project documentation (this folder)
├── apps/              # Child repos containing actual applications
│   ├── app-name-1/
│   ├── app-name-2/
│   └── ...
├── web/               # Website source code
└── README.md
```

## Design Inspiration

The UI for Adamosophy is inspired by the **Couchers.org** GitHub repository. We adopt their clean, documentation-focused design patterns including:

- **Drawer-style left navbar** for intuitive document navigation
- Feature-rich Markdown rendering for beautiful documentation
- Responsive design that works across devices
- Clean typography and readable layouts

This approach ensures our documentation is not just functional but also a pleasure to read and navigate.

## Documentation System

All project documentation lives in the `docs/` folder at the repository root. The landing page provides a full-featured documentation reader with:

- Collapsible drawer navigation on the left
- Rich Markdown rendering with syntax highlighting
- Table of contents generation
- Search functionality
- Responsive mobile-friendly design

Navigate through the documents using the left sidebar to explore the full vision and technical details of Adamosophy.
