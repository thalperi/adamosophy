# Agent Instructions & Session Log

## 1. Core Operational Constraints

*   **No Unauthorized Coding**: Do not code or modify anything without **explicit instruction** and **permission** from the user.
*   **Verification First**: Before acting, always verify the current state of the workspace (file existence, content, build status). Never assume prior steps were completed correctly due to potential context loss.
*   **Documentation Review**: Always review `wip.md` and other project definition documents before starting work to understand the current project state.

## 2. GitHub Interaction Protocols

*   **Authentication**: Use the provided `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to access the repository.
*   **Branch Strategy**: Commit and push directly to the `main` branch. **Do not create new branches** unless explicitly instructed.
*   **Build Verification**: After pushing a commit that triggers a build:
    1.  **Wait** for the GitHub Actions build to complete.
    2.  **Verify** the build status (success/failure) via logs or API.
    3.  **Report** back to the user only after confirming the actual result.
    *   *Critical*: Do not claim success until the build has actually passed.

## 3. Session Context: Build Failure & Resolution (Commit 866b672)

**Issue**: The build triggered by commit `866b672` (Interactive Sidebar feature) failed.
**Error**: `Expected "(" but found "type"` in API routes (`update-doc-metadata.ts`, `update-doc-order.ts`, `upload-image.ts`).
**Root Cause**: Astro's static build mode (using esbuild) cannot parse TypeScript `import type` syntax inside `.ts` API route files when combined with frontmatter delimiters.
**Resolution**:
*   Changed `import type { APIRoute } from 'astro';` to `import { APIRoute } from 'astro';`.
*   Removed unnecessary trailing frontmatter delimiters (`---`) from API route files.
*   Verified fix by waiting for successful build completion.

## 4. Feature Implementation Log

### A. Resizable Sidebar
*   **Requirement**: Make the documentation drawer resizable, defaulting to 30% wider than the original (21rem vs 16rem).
*   **Implementation**:
    *   Added a resize handle on the right edge of the sidebar.
    *   Implemented drag logic updating CSS custom property `--sidebar-width`.
    *   Added touch event support for mobile devices.
    *   Saved width preference to `localStorage`.
*   **Mobile Fix**: Initial implementation failed on mobile (drawer collapsed). Fixed by switching from `display: none` toggle to an off-canvas transform pattern (`translate-x`) ensuring the drawer renders correctly on small screens.

### B. Document Gallery (Docs Landing Page)
*   **Requirement**: Create a Google Docs-style gallery view with Card/List toggle.
*   **Implementation**:
    *   Created a landing page at `/docs` listing all markdown files.
    *   Added a toggle button to switch between Grid (Card) and List views.
    *   Saved view preference to `localStorage`.

### C. UI Architecture Documentation
*   **Inspiration**: Modeled after **Couchers.org** UI design principles (flattering imitation).
*   **Action**: Created/Updated `ui.md` to document layout systems, component libraries, and interaction patterns based on this inspiration.

## 5. Current Project State

*   **Frontend**: Interactive sidebar (drag-and-drop reordering, accordion metadata editor, resizing) is functional.
*   **Backend**: API endpoints exist but currently log changes; full GitHub write-back integration (Octokit) is pending.
*   **Documentation**: All docs (`wip.md`, `ui.md`, `agent.md`) are beautified with enhanced Markdown structure.
*   **Build Status**: Stable (pending next change).

## 6. Pending Tasks / Backlog

1.  **GitHub Integration**: Install `octokit` and `gray-matter` to enable API endpoints to actually commit/push file changes back to the repo.
2.  **Image Uploads**: Implement real file storage logic in `/api/upload-image` (currently a stub).
3.  **Refinement**: Continue refining mobile responsiveness and touch interactions based on user feedback.
